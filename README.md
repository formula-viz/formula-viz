# 🏎️ formula-viz

formula-viz ingests raw F1 telemetry data from qualifying sessions and converts it into cinematically rendered 3D visualizations. The system automatically:
- Processes telemetry from FastF1 API
- Constructs accurate track layouts with proper racing lines
- Positions and animates cars with precise physics-based movement
- Renders high-quality video with dynamic overlays, timing information, and leaderboards
- Publishes content to YouTube automatically via GitHub Actions

## 🚀 CICD

- Automated testing with pytest
- GPU-accelerated rendering on GitHub runners
- Continuous deployment to YouTube

## 🎬 Example
The system produces full qualifying sessions rendered in both desktop (16:9) and mobile (9:16) formats:
